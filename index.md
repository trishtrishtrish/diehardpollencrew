This year, for the first time ever, we have summoned a new spirit from the netherworld: THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PASTIMES.

Make no mistake, we’re not here to celebrate 8 pound 6 ounce newborn infant jesus, we’re here to celebrate the true meaning of the holidays; the realization of the American dream. We will gorge ourselves on the richest foods, partake in only the shiniest decorations, and worship only the finest in traded commercial goods.

Please direct any questions, suggestions, or requests for removal to the representatives anointed by our precious spirit: Welch Canavan (devout atheist, inheritor of Catholic guilt), Meg Levine (the Jewish mother you always wanted and never had), Blake Underwood (Hitler’s dream, the third reich incarnate). If you’re wondering what is going on, this is a reverent continuation of the FTW Diehard Skeleton Crew that can be learned about at [https://ftwdiehardskeletoncrew.wordpress.com/]().

Behold our schedule of slothful celebration:

## Wildcard

If and when OPM calls a snow day hurry to the grocery sore to get TP, water, and snacks then head to The Command Center. We will have sleds stockpiled.
