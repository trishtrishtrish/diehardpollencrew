- **New Year’s Eve (Dec. 31)**: We can’t believe another year’s gone by and still nothing (NOTHING!) as if we didn’t even try… Come stand in front of the kitchen window with your friends buck naked, drenched in sparkling cider, looking at a bunch of strangers looking at them, looking at us, looking at them…
- **New Year’s Day (Jan. 1)**: We’ll give you plenty of time to recover from partying and then we’ll have breakfast for dinner.
