- **Ice Skating/ Watch A Very Murray Christmas (December 4)**: First we’ll meet at the National Gallery of Art Ice Rink. Then we’ll retire to the command center to watch the debut Bill Murray’s christmas special (sure to be an instant classic).
- **Make Gingerbread Houses (Dec. 5)**: Welch’s mom will be restarting a dormant Canavan tradition for us. Come assemble gingerbread homes with the aid of a fifteen year old pug who will beg for food literally the entire time. Welch’s mom’s house, time TBA
- **Chanukah white elephant (Dec 6)**: gift exchange in honor of Chanukah.
