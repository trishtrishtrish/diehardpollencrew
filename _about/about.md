**Rub the sleep from your eyes and take a good stretch. Social hibernation is over.**   

It is the magical season of birth, renewal, and the end of seasonal affective disorder. There are lots of birthdays in the coming months, and we're going to celebrate birth and friends to the max. We will delight in the return of fresh produce as we peel away our winter layers. We will meet new friends and share our love or ambivalence for baseball. Then we will celebrate the birth of our new friendships while all the earth spits up flowers around us.

**Stock up on the Claritin, take a deep breath, and get sprung.**  

Hopefully, you are finally sleeping through the night after the [Diehard Skeleton](https://ftwdiehardskeletoncrew.wordpress.com/) haunts and have shed your extra [Diehard Tinsel](diehardtinselcrew.com) cookie pounds because we have a 3 month marathon of social revelry ahead of us.
The schedule is less dense than predecessors' but longer. Endurance is the name of this game.
There's a bunch of birthdays on this schedule. You are encouraged to get involved in the creative brainstorming and execution of these celebrations. Got a request/birthday/activity to add? Let Trish know!
